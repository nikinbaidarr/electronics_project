2) Gas leakage detector

- In this system, we've made use of gas sensor(MQ-6) and GSM. The gas
  sensor, whenever there's leakage of LPG gas in the room, gets triggered
  or sensor sends input to the arduino. Arduino is coded in such way that
  whenever it gets an input from the sensor, GSM sends a predefined
  message to the user or the owner.

- The sensitive material of MQ-2 gas sensor is SnO2 ,considered as lower
  conductivity in the clean air.

- As a working principle, in these the sensor area is heated to a constant
  temperature (few hundred Â°C) and in the presence of a combustible gas
  the electrical resistivity drops, the conductivity of the sensor gets
  higher proportionally with gas concentration .

-An automatic signal excites the GSM shield to broadcast the condition of
the environment as an SMS to a corresponding phone number( given in the
code).
