impinging upon it, which varies depending on the temperature and surface
characteristics of the objects in front of the sensor. PIR sensor consists
of pyroelectric sensor, which generates energy when exposed to
heat/infrared radiation.

So, when a person appears in front of the sensor or sensor's field of view
it will detect their presence because human body emits heat energy in the
form of infrared radiation. Whenever the person passes through the
sensor's field of view, the temperature at that point in the sensor's
field of view will rise from room temperature to body temperature, and
then back again. The sensor converts the resulting change in the incoming
infrared radiation into a change in the output voltage, and this triggers
the detection.

Based on this principle we design an automated trash can.
