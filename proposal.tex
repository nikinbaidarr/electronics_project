  The absence of biological markers makes it exceptionally difficult
  for neurologists to diagnose a person with a mental disorder.
  Currently, diagnosis of mental disorders is based on behavioral
  observations and patient-reported symptoms and the Diagnostic and
  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) classification.

  Although there have been thousands of studies revolving around
  implementation of various imaging modalities for deciphering the
  etiology and the physical cause of several mental disorders, the
  findings from these studies do not appear amongst the diagnostic
  criteria. Meaning that, Reverse fallacy ko appropriate example.

  For this reason alone (reverse inference fallacy), neuroimaging is
  not ``widely accepted'' in the process of psychiatric diagnosis.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Major Depressive Disorder}

Major Depressive Disorder, generally abbreviated as MDD, is one of the
most common and a serious mental disorder. MDD is also referred to as
clinical depression.

MDD can be characterized by an array of distinct symptoms such as a
persistent felling of sadness, feelings of low self-worth and guilt,
and an overall reduced ability to take pleasure from activities that
previously were enjoyable.

Although, the exact symptoms of depression may vary from person to
person, depending on their upbringing and various socio-demographic
variables such as age, gender, religious affiliations, employment,
income etc; for an individual to be classified as ``suffering from
Major Depressive Disorder'', 5 out of 10 symptoms, one from a set of
two and at least four additional symptoms from another set of 5, must
have to have been present as a bare minimum during span of 2 weeks.
% insert WHO reference here

MDD has similarities with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

diagnosis based on symptoms and behavioral observations.

\subsection{Brain Networks}

A brain network, on a large scale, can be defined as a collection of
brain regions working together to produce a specific function.

Brain networks can be identified at various different resolutions,
therefore there is no universal atlas of brain networks that fits all
circumstances. However, on the basis of converging evidences from
related studies, there are six large-scale, core brain networks that
are most widely accepted due to their stability:

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item Default Mode Network
  \item Salience Network
  \item Dorsal Attention Network
  \item Frontoparietal Network
  \item Sensorimotor Network
  \item Visual Cortex
\end{enumerate}

There are more subsets of these six networks such as the limbic,
auditory, right/left executive, cerebellar, spatial attention,
language, lateral visual, temporal and visual perception/imagery.

An emerging paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive tasks are
performed not by individual brain regions working in isolation but
rather by brain networks consisting of several discrete brain regions
that are said to be ``functionally connected''.

The functional connectivity of brain networks can be acknowledged (or
understood) through statistical analysis of images acquired through a
variety of techniques such as the fMRI BOLD signals, or other signals
acquired through techniques such as the EEG, PET or SPECT.

It is suspected that the default mode network is the epicenter of
depression.

Such statistical approach to image analysis makes it possible to
discover, spatial and temporal patterns that correspond to performance
of specific tasks and specific diagnoses. Statistical methods have
only been begun to be applied to clinical disorders but show promise
for increasing the ``specificity'' of brain imaging markers for mental
illness such as the MDD.

The functional connectivity of these brain networks can may be found
using several different techniques. The ICA and the SCA are more
common amongst the others.

\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Need For An Imaging Basis}

The diagnosis procedures that are the gold standard for diagnosis of
psychiatric disorders are wholly based on behavioral observations and
patient reported symptoms. There are two most widely established
symptoms that are used to classify these manifestations, one is the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the
other is International Classification for Diseases (ICD).

Despite each being as widely used as the other, both of these
diagnosis manuals are more like frameworks provide a way of
classifying a psychiatric disorder depending on patterns of behaviour
rather than interpreting the etiology and the physical cause of those
disorders.

This statement alone raises an argument that ``although reliable,
current diagnostic procedures in psychiatry are not entirely valid''.

\iffalse
Reliable in the sense that any trained professional will arrive at
the same diagnosis for each patient.

Valid in the sense that it reflects the underlying psychological
and biological commonalities and differences among different
disorders to a certain extent. Validity continues to be more
difficult to achieve.
\fi

Let us take an example of the diagnostic procedure involved in the
diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. The DSM-V, published in 2013,
is the most up-to-date manual and is based upon the work of expert
study groups and makes use of large sets of data. According to the
DSM-V, for a person to be classified as "suffering from Major
Depressive Disorder", \textit{he/she must report with either depressed
mood or anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure in normally pleasurable
activities) along with four out of eight additional symptoms}.

This makes it totally possible for 2 distinct individuals who do not
share a single symptom in common and yet receive treatment (or
medication) for MDD.

Furthermore, the current diagnostic procedures such as the DSM-V are
not entirely bulletproof. For example, impulsivity, emotional lability
(the property of changing rapidly), and difficulty with concentration
each occurs in more than one disorder.

Now, the fact that,

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item Different exemplars of the same category can share no
    symptoms and that
  \item The exemplars of two different categories may share common
    symptoms
\end{enumerate}

raises questions about the validity of the current diagnostic
procedures in psychiatry. Therefore, an imaging basis is necessary for
the diagnosis of mental disorders.

WHY IMAGING WON'T WORK?

There exists thousands of published research studies using
functional neuroimaging methods such as SPECT, PET, and fMRI.

Findings from brain imaging do not appear amongst the diagnostic
criteria. aside from its use to rule out potential physical causes
of a patient's condition, for example a brain tumor, neuroimaging
is not used in the process of psychiatric diagnosis.

Why has diagnostic neuroimaging not yet found a place in
psychiatric practice? Sensitivity, specificity and standardization
in psychiatric brain imaging.

    - Diagnosis must be made for individuals and not groups
    - meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies has yet to reveal
      patterns of neural activity that are unique to specific
      mental disorder

Sensitivity

Imaging studies are generally not highly sensitive to the
difference between illness and health

Specificity:

Most psychiatric imaging studies involve subjects from only two
categories- patients from a single diagnostic category and people
without any psychiatric diagnosis (healthy individuals), the most
that can be learned from such a study is how brain activation in
those with a particular disorder differs from brain activation in
those without a disorder.

This raises a dilemma for the diagnosing clinician, as the
question is not "does this person have disorder X or is she
healthy? " but "does this patient have disorder X,Y,Z or is she
healthy?" because the pattern of images that distinguishes
patients with disorder X from healthy people may not be unique to
X but shared with a whole alphabet of other disorders.

For example, Amygdala ko example

- (more sophisticated) methods of image analysis may hold promise
  discerning the underlying differences among the many disorders
  that feature similar regional abnormalities !??


- ``statistical approach'' to image analysis makes it possible to
  discover, \underline{spatial and temporal} patterns that
  correspond to performance of specific tasks and specific
  diagnoses. Such statistical methods have only been begun to be
  applied to clinical disorders but show promise for increasing
  the ``specificity'' of brain imaging markers for mental illness.


near-term and long-term prospects of neuroimaging? and what
obstacles block the use of such methods? Answer to the 2nd: The
nature of imaging studies and of psychiatric diagnosis.

Standardization

Standardization is relevant in the sense that protocols for
imaging studies differ from study to study, particularly amongst
functional imaging studies.

The results of psychiatric imaging research are often summarized
by stating that certain regions are under or over active or more
or less functionally connected.

Findings on the patterns of activation acquired in studies of
psychiatric patients depends strongly on the task being performed
by the subjects and the statistical comparisons made by the
researcher afterwards. Such findings are pretty much incomplete
unless they include the information about what task evoked the
activation in question: whether the patient wa resting, processing
an emotional stimuli, resisting emotional stimuli or engaged in
some other task?

Therefore the fact that imaging study's conclusions are relative
to the tasks performed adds further complexity to the problem of
consistently discriminating patterns of activation of healthy and
ill subjects.

\section{Review of Literature}

% opening note:

Implementation of fMR-imaging techniques to research the core aspects
of structural and functional brain alterations in patients suffering
from MDD.

Past work seems like structural MRI and fMRI look promising for
providing excellent and reliable indexes for the aid in the diagnosis
and ultimately treatment of MDD
